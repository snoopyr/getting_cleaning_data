# Getting and Cleaning Data project

Contains R script run_analysis.R.
Cleans up raw data obtained from a set of measurements from the accelerometer
and gyroscope in a mobile phone attached to subjects performing various
activities.

Data automatically downloaded from within the script. The output is a
cleaned up data file consisting of only the mean and standard deviations 
of the various measurements. This is stored in a file tidyData.txt.
The descriptions of the various fields are given in the CodeBook.md file.

Download the script and run from a clean directory.
